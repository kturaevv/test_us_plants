# Build an API

## Summary:
- We want to show a map to visualize the annual net generation of power plants in the US
- We want to display the top-n plants
- We want to show the actual and percentage values of the plants' federal state
- We want to be able to filter by state
- We want to be able to see a single plant's details

## Requirements:
- Build a *RESTful API* service, in *Python* or *Node.js*, that will back the application
- *Use a database and preload the service with data* from https://www.epa.gov/energy/emissions-generation-resource-integrated-database-egrid (eGRID Data File)
- Secure the API resources with a very simple scheme to let only an authenticated user access them
- Run the API service in a Docker container

## Deliverables:

### Source Code:
- Include all the necessary code files and scripts required.

### Documentation:
- Write a README file that explains the setup and usage instructions for app.
- Include a description of the components, their functionality, and any dependencies.

### Bonus
Not required but nice to have (bonus points):
- Build a simple UI powered by the API service
- Deploy the service in the cloud

## Submission:

Please submit your code through Github or Gitlab. Provide clear instructions on how to set up and run the data pipeline.

If you have any questions about the requirements, please feel free to reach out to us.

You will be asked *to present your solution to the team* during the interview. You have *7 days* to complete the challenge.

## Notes

We are interested in a *real-world solution* and not in over-engineered nor code golf solutions, so please provide a solution as you would normally produce at work as that is what we want to see from you.
